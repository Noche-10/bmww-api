# bmww-api

Disclaimers: 

- This is not an official api and it is quite weak but it gets the job done. 

- DO NOT ABUSE REQUESTS SINCE IT CAN BE HARMFUL FOR THE WEB PAGE.


Notes:


- As said before this is not an official api and it was made by one person, so if you see any errors in the code or see a better way to do code it and know how to do it, you are welcome to edit it.


- Information like genres or information that can be a list (ex: genres, categories, challenges, series) can't be accessed individually due to the way that the html was written. Again if you find a way to fix it or make it possible to access this information individually you are welcome to do it


- If you want to access information like the ones stated above you would have to do .complete_info this will get the work's complete info 


- I may be updating this project with new features, however i don't really have much time to do it and since this is one of my first times using beautiful soup the code maybe a bit messy and with a lot of errors.
